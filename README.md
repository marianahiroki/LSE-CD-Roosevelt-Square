# LSE-CD-Roosevelt-Square
Franklin Roosevelt Square: A Public Space Resistance in Sao Paulo City Centre was an essay written for LSE's MSc City Design and Social Science.

## Introduction/Context: ##

- **Transit-Oriented Urban Development:** Originating from 1950s urban planning, the square's history reflects the transit-oriented design and the influence of surrounding private land donated to the municipality.
- **Community Exclusion in Design:** The square's opening in 1969, devoid of community involvement, led to disuse, lack of investment, and subsequent degradation, fostering conflicts among diverse user groups and governance levels.
- **Renovation and Persistent Challenges:** Despite a 2011 renovation and reopening in 2012 with a police headquarters, conflicts between various user groups persist, illustrating ongoing challenges in reconciling diverse interests within the space.
- Visual analysis through QGIS maps supports deeper socio-spatial discussions.

## Objectives: ##

- Understanding the socio-spatial dynamics in this public space over time and its influence on the surrounding areas.
- Addressing inquiries about the key actors and their roles in the transformation and partial governance of the square.

## Data Collection and Analysis: ##

- Data sources included academic works, surveys and open data, mostly sourced from the Sao Paulo Prefecture Open Data and Geosampa website.
- The following maps, produced with QGIS and numerous sources, aided in understanding the context of Rosevelt Square in its municipality.

It is an instrument established by the Cities Statute (federal law 10.257/01) that grants the property owner the right to build beyond the basic constructive potential upon payment of a financial consideration that follows the land values.

## Key Learnings/Insights: ##

- **Dictatorship-Era Urban Development:** Focus on motorways and elite interests shaped Praca Franklin Roosevelt, undermining its democratic symbolism as a public space.
- **Unfair Design Changes:** Issues arose from an unfair design process, lack of community involvement, and police presence, contradicting the space's democratic essence.
- **Public-Private Partnership Impact:** Entrepreneurial urban governance led to a public-private partnership as the sole solution for maintaining space "quality," exacerbating exclusion among specific societal groups.

## Impact/Results: ##

- **Square Usage & Perceptions:** Despite being residents, users visit the square infrequently due to perceived safety concerns and limited amenities. The majority spend an hour or more for social gatherings or cultural events but express dissatisfaction with the square's maintenance and safety, which requires more police presence and better lighting.
- **Square Improvement Suggestions:** Participants suggest increased police surveillance, improved lighting, and more cultural events. However, debates persist on the efficacy of these measures in enhancing safety due to social disparities and ineffective governance. Augusta Park's (very close to Roosevelt Square location) recent opening offers an alternative space, perceived as a triumph by some but criticized for reinforcing societal exclusions.
- **Gentrification and Changing Urban Dynamics:** A shift in Sao Paulo's city centre toward gentrification is marked by developments and the establishment of new "green spaces." Questions arise regarding the future direction of global cities and the exacerbation of societal disparities through such urban changes.
- A truly public and democratic space thrives when diverse groups use it without prejudice, benefitting themselves and others. Encouraging diverse use and providing affordable cultural spaces, services, and housing nearby can enhance the sense of safety and inclusivity.

## Challenges and Solutions: ##

- In academic work, offering reciprocity to survey or interview participants can be challenging. Initially, eliciting responses for my online survey was difficult, and some participants, particularly academics, requested access to the final paper.
- The findings from this survey may be influenced by methodological biases. Conducting further in-person research could yield a more comprehensive understanding of the square's dynamics and the needs of the community. Given that this research took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching individuals without internet access was particularly challenging.
- Some of the specific data I sought was hard to find. It seems that the websites I used have undergone updates since my last review.

## Future Steps/Recommendations: ##

- Initiatives like protests and community events can effectively activate the space and foster inclusivity. Leveraging online platforms, leaflets, and other communication channels can promote these events.
- For researchers interested in studying this square, it's highly recommended to thoroughly examine available data, especially its evolution over time, along with the evolving perceptions of the square and its immediate surroundings.

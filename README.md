# LSE-CD-Roosevelt-Square
Franklin Roosevelt Square: A Public Space Resistance in Sao Paulo City Centre was an essay written for LSE's MSc City Design and Social Science.

## Introduction/Context: ##

- **Transit-Oriented Urban Development:** Originating from 1950s urban planning, the square's history reflects the transit-oriented design and the influence of surrounding private land donated to the municipality.
- **Community Exclusion in Design:** The square's opening in 1969, devoid of community involvement, led to disuse, lack of investment, and subsequent degradation, fostering conflicts among diverse user groups and governance levels.
- **Renovation and Persistent Challenges:** Despite a 2011 renovation and reopening in 2012 with a police headquarters, conflicts between various user groups persist, illustrating ongoing challenges in reconciling diverse interests within the space.
- Visual analysis through QGIS maps supports deeper socio-spatial discussions.

## Objectives: ##

- Understanding the socio-spatial dynamics in this public space through the years and its impact on the surroundings.
- To answer the question who and how the main players are responsible for transforming and partially controlling the square?
- Socio-Spatial Analysis: Emphasis on diverse methods for understanding sites, exploring procedural and formal intervention possibilities, encompassing spatial design models, city-making practices, and public/private actions.

## Data Collection and Analysis: ##

- Data sources included academic works, surveys and open data, mostly sourced from the Sao Paulo Prefecture Open Data and Geosampa website.
- The following maps, produced with QGIS and numerous sources, aided in understanding the context of Rosevelt Square in its municipality.
